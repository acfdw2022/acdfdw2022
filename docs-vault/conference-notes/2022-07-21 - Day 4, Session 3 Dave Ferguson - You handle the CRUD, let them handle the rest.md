HAS ANYONE EVER SUCCESFULLY SWITCHED A PROJECT FROM ONE DB TECH TO ANOTHER BY SIMPLY CHANGING A CF DATA SOURCE?

reapply the logs? I can see Dave hand crafting SQL restores from looking at old cfmail files, apache server logs, maybe something that happened to capture the post requests with data throughout that time.  





who handles calls from the customer? They get more out of joint about not taking a call than the downtime. I understand that.
