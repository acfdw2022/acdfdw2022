## `docs-vault/` - Obsidian Vault
- That is where you are!
- We will call this the `Vault Root` from now on.
- That `"Vault"` is where [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) magic comes into play.

- Install/Open [`Obsidian` _(for free)_](https://obsidian.md/)
	-  Click `"Open folder as vault"`
	- open the vault folder [`./obsvault-tiller22./`](docs/).
